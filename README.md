# Nexus

PROBLEM: I have an avid passion for futurism and the technological singularity. Most people only see the doom and gloom with the future, whereas I see utopia.


SOLUTION: I created a store of the future with items that would give a glimpse into it and bring hope and optimism:

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, TypeScript, NextJS, React, TailwindCSS.

-Visitors can explore the array of products that will be available in the future, when we have reached the singularity.

## Optimizations (*Contributions Welcome*)

-Add some pages for each item with a description for that item.

-Add routing to some of the links that are there just for show.

## Lessons Learned:

-NextJS makes stuff extremely easy in terms of smoothness and not having to use a bunch of tech.

-Found and used a bunch of libraries for easy implementation of certain UI features.

-Typescript static typing and interface defining, and also CSS syntax with tailwind.

-Having to add a linting comment for ESLint in 2 components because deployment was failing due to it.
